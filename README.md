Mundasia
========
The Mundasia project aims to create a multiplayer online roleplaying game that places greatest
emphasis on immersion and internal consistency of the world as viewed from in world.

Resources are pointedly not excessively modern, with the ideal being to allow relatively-inexperienced
users to provide easily-expanded resources (such as terrain, which can be roughly as diverse as the
imaginations of players) even if they cannot provide code to the project. This is meant to support
the project being free (as opposed to "freemium" games actually powered by microtransactions) and 
relatively open.

Game system and world are unique to the setting, to avoid clashing with published/copyrighted works.
